When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When I want other people to collaborate in a project of mine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Because I wouldn't want to pull unfinished and unproven changes to my offline repo.
