When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When I want other people to collaborate in a project of mine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Because I wouldn't want to pull unfinished and unproven changes to my offline repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?
    Branches are made within a repository, clone is a local copy of a local or
    a remote repo, while fork is a copy on GitHub of another repo on GitHub.
    I would use "branch" for adding a new feat or experimenting on a master branch,
    "clone" for copying locally a repo from GitHub, and "fork" for copying a
    repo from someone else's GitHub account on my own GitHub account.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    The ability to keep track if local and remote branches are in sync.
