When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When I want other people to collaborate in a project of mine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?
    Branches are made within a repository, clone is a local copy of a local or
    a remote repo, while fork is a copy on GitHub of another repo on GitHub.
    I would use "branch" for adding a new feat or experimenting on a master branch,
    "clone" for copying locally a repo from GitHub, and "fork" for copying a
    repo from someone else's GitHub account on my own GitHub account.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    The ability to keep track if local and remote branches are in sync.
