How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By showing the deleted and added lines in changed files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By providing ability to go back in time to a specific version and fix bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Commits are logical and can be named logically for easier search later
    Cons: One can forget to create a commit after an important change in the code

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because software projects mainly involve multiple interconnected files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all commits up to the current commit
    git diff shows all changes made between any two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because any harmful changes to the code can be simply rolled-back and cancelled

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For all of my software projects other than the really simple ones
